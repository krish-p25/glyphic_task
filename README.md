#Objective
Build a full-stack web application that enables users to search and analyze their historical
sales calls in Glyphic using natural language.
The application should integrate with Glyphic’s public API and allow users to ask questions
and receive answers based on the transcripts of past calls. Access to call media or call
snippets is not required.
