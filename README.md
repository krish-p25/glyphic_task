#Objective
Build a full-stack web application that enables users to search and analyze their historical
sales calls in Glyphic using natural language.
The application should integrate with Glyphic’s public API and allow users to ask questions
and receive answers based on the transcripts of past calls. Access to call media or call
snippets is not required.

#AI Assistance
The main AI tool used in assistance with this project is Open AI's Codex via terminal.

Codex has been used to create a polished, user-friendly React interface for the user frontend. This includes providing a basic description and framework of the Chat page, and asking it to add polish the UI to make it look modern, by adding the relevant tailwind classes.
